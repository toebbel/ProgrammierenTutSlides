Programmieren Tutorial Slides
======================

I held a tutorial in winter term 2011/2012 about the stuff from the freshmen lecture "Programmieren" (Java).
These are only slides, which I created with the help of some colleagues. 
There are plenty of materials, that were provided by the KIT and are under copyright.
